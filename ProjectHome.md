Starscape is a 2D persistent multi player strategy game with an Asteroids look to it. The universe is composed of star systems, each hosted on a separate server instance. Each star system is populated by a variety of natural objects, such as gases, dust, asteroids, planets and wormholes to other systems. Artificial features include the wreckage of past players and units, and computer controlled players with special roles.
Players control a fleet of units such as shuttles, builder/breakers, habitats and factories. The focus is on building, organization and interaction among groups of players supported by agents. Transportation requirements will limit the spread of a group; fuel and FAW (food, air, water) is finite and resources must be at the same location as unit that would use them.
Combat is a relatively minor focus for the RTS genre. Weapons include bullets, missiles and drone mines (a patient missile).
